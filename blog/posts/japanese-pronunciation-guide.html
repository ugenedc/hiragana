        <h2>Understanding Japanese Sounds</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Vowels are pronounced clearly and consistently</li>
            <li>Each syllable is given equal stress</li>
            <li>There are no silent letters</li>
            <li>Pitch accent varies by region</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Pronunciation Challenges</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Long vowels (marked with a macron)</li>
            <li>Double consonants (small tsu „Å£)</li>
            <li>Pitch accent patterns</li>
            <li>R-sounds (different from English)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practice Tips for Better Pronunciation</h2>
        <p>Improve your Japanese pronunciation with these effective strategies:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Record yourself speaking and compare with native speakers</li>
            <li>Use our Hiragana flashcards with audio</li>
            <li>Practice with Japanese songs and anime</li>
            <li>Focus on one sound at a time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Technology to Improve</h2>
        <p>Modern tools can help you master Japanese pronunciation:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Speech recognition apps</li>
